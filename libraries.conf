    longDescription: """In general, anything you can do with an array in NetLogo, you could also just use a list for. But you may want to consider using an array instead for speed reasons. Lists and arrays have different performance characteristics, so you may be able to make your model run faster by selecting the appropriate data structure.

Arrays are useful when you need a collection of values whose size is fixed. You can quickly access or alter any item in an array if you know its position.

Unlike NetLogo’s lists and strings, arrays are “mutable”. That means that you can actually modify them directly, rather than constructing an altered copy as with lists. If the array is used in more than one place in your code, any changes you make will show up everywhere. It’s tricky to write code involving mutable structures and it’s easy to make subtle errors or get surprising results, so we suggest sticking with lists and strings unless you’re certain you want and need mutability."""

It allows users to do things such as starting a simulation on 1 January of 2010 and end on 31 December 2015, have each tick represent 6 hours, and check whether the current simulation date is between 1 and 15 March.

Modelers commonly need to use time series data in NetLogo. The time extension provides convenient primitives for handling time series data. With a single command, you can load an entire time series data set from a text file. The first column in that text file holds dates or datetimes. The remaining columns can be numeric or string values. You then access the data by time and by column heading, akin to saying "get the flow from May 8, 2008".

The time extension enables a different approach to scheduling actions in NetLogo. Traditionally, a NetLogo modeler puts a series of actions or procedure calls into the "go" procedure, which is executed once each tick. Sometimes it is more natural or more efficient to instead say "have agent X execute procedure Y at time Z". This is what discrete event scheduling (also know as "dynamic scheduling") enables. Discrete event simulation has a long history and extensive literature, and this extension makes it much easier to use in NetLogo."""
