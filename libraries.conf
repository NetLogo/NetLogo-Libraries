  {
    name: "Stats"
    shortDescription: ""
    longDescription: """The “stats” extension provides basic statistical functions for data generated within NetLogo models. stats maintains an internal data table of observations on an arbitrary number of variables and allows the user to find such statistics for the data as the means, medians, quantiles, percentiles, standard deviations, and variance-covariance and correlation matrices; to regress one or more variables on another; and to forecast the value of any variable into the future based on past observations. Regression statistics include R2, Adjusted R2, F and the probability of F, and for each of the coefficients, the standard error, T statistic and probability of the T statistic. stats also provides values of and the areas under the normal, log-normal, student, binomial, gamma, beta and Chi-Square distributions, and, for some, their inverses.

Although stats can be used to analyze the overall results of a run of a model, it is intended mostly for the use of “smart” agents who gather and analyze data in order to make decisions. Agents can maintain their private data tables, or use tables shared as globals, or both."""
